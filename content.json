[cite: 502, 63, 64] A significant number of these patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, making them ineligible for surgical treatments. [cite: 502, 63, 64] In such cases, traditional treatment methods like thermal ablation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy often yield unsatisfactory results due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor. [cite: 503, 65] The propensity of liver cancer to metastasize adds another layer of difficulty to treatment and severely impacts patient prognosis. [cite: 504, 66] Consequently, there’s a critical need for research focused on developing effective combination therapies that can enhance treatment efficacy and reduce metastasis. [cite: 505, 67] Combination therapy, which strategically employs multiple treatment modalities, has emerged as a promising approach to improve outcomes. [cite: 493, 54] By targeting various pathways and modulating the tumor’s immune microenvironment, combination therapy can more effectively disrupt cancer progression. [cite: 493, 54] Among the innovative tools being explored for liver cancer treatment, nanodrug delivery systems hold significant promise. [cite: 494, 55] These systems offer the potential for targeted drug delivery, reduced toxicity, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. [cite: 494, 55] This study introduces a novel nano ultrasound contrast agent, abbreviated as ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD, designed to integrate diagnosis and treatment for efficient ultrasound imaging and liver cancer therapy. [cite: 495, 56] The core components of this system are: Arsenic trioxide (ATO): A therapeutic agent known to induce ferroptosis, a distinct form of programmed cell death, in tumor cells. [cite: 495, 56, 512, 74] Perfluorohexane (PFH): A substance used to enhance the ultrasound echo signal. [cite: 495, 56, 528, 94] Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs): Act as a carrier for ATO and PFH and facilitate photothermal therapy (PTT). [cite: 495, 56, 508, 70] cRGD peptide: A targeting ligand that enhances the delivery of the nano-agent to liver cancer cells. [cite: 495, 56, 529, 95] The research demonstrates that this nanodrug delivery system promotes the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) through ATO-induced ferroptosis and photothermal-induced immunogenic cell death. [cite: 496, 57] This process enhances the synergistic effects of ATO and photothermal therapy in human Huh7 and mouse Hepa1-6 cells. [cite: 496, 57] A key finding of the study is the system’s ability to activate the antitumor immune response and promote macrophage M1 polarization within the tumor microenvironment. [cite: 497, 58] Notably, these beneficial effects were observed with low side effects in both subcutaneous and orthotopic liver cancer models. [cite: 497, 58] Furthermore, the research reveals that combining the nanodrug delivery system with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy inhibits tumor metastasis and establishes long-term immunological memory in orthotopic liver cancer. [cite: 498, 59] This combination not only enhances antitumor therapy and suppresses lung metastasis but also enables visual assessment of therapeutic efficacy. [cite: 499, 60] These capabilities highlight the significant potential of this nano-agent for clinical applications in treating liver cancer. [cite: 499, 60] Detailed Discussion of Key Components and Mechanisms Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) and Ferroptosis Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has shown considerable clinical benefits in the palliative treatment of unresectable primary liver cancer. [cite: 518, 83] However, its clinical application is limited by high systemic toxicity, rapid renal elimination of ATO, and low delivery efficiency to liver cancer cells, which greatly reduce the therapeutic efficacy and lead to severe systemic toxicity. [cite: 519, 84, 520, 85, 86] To address these limitations, nanotechnology-based nanodrug delivery systems offer a promising solution. [cite: 521, 87] These systems can significantly improve the efficacy of ATO, reduce its toxicity, and achieve targeted drug delivery in liver cancer. [cite: 521, 87] Since ATO has a strong affinity for sulfhydryl groups (SH) in proteins, it can theoretically inactivate a variety of enzymes containing SH, such as glutathione (GSH). [cite: 521, 87] Glutathione (GSH) could assist glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in reducing toxic lipid peroxides (LPOs) to nontoxic hydroxy compound (LOH) to prevent LPO-mediated damage to cell membrane structure and function. [cite: 522, 88] The depletion of GSH could result in the inhibition of GPX4 activity and a corresponding increase in intracellular LPO levels, ultimately leading to ferroptosis. [cite: 522, 88] Therefore, ATO may induce ferroptosis through GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation. [cite: 522, 88] Moreover, the ferroptosis-induced release of TAAs from dying cancer cells could further enhance the immune response. [cite: 522, 88] Photothermal Therapy (PTT) and Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an anticancer strategy that offers precise targeting of tumors with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. [cite: 506, 68, 507, 69] Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are well-suited for PTT applications due to their good biocompatibility and excellent optical properties. [cite: 508, 70] When AuNPs are exposed to near-infrared (NIR) light, they efficiently absorb the light energy and convert it into heat. [cite: 509, 71] This photothermal effect can damage tumor tissues or release therapeutic molecules, such as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). [cite: 509, 71, 516, 80] However, the therapeutic effect of AuNPs alone may be limited. [cite: 516, 80, 517, 81] The synergistic effect of combined chemo-PTT may be a promising strategy for improving PTT efficacy. [cite: 517, 81, 506, 68] Ultrasound-Targeted Microbubble Destruction (UTMD) Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) can be exploited to change the structures of cells to facilitate the targeted release of nanodrugs into tumor cells, which could improve the efficacy of tumor treatment and prevent the systemic toxicity of antitumor drugs. [cite: 525, 91] The nanoparticles (NPs) accumulate in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and targeting effect. [cite: 526, 92] Then, UTMD can increase the permeability of the cell membrane through the cavitation effect so that the drugs loaded in NPs are more easily released and taken up. [cite: 527, 93] Moreover, NPs can also load imaging agents for visualizing therapy, such as perfluorohexane (PFH). [cite: 528, 94] The Role of cRGD Peptide In this study, the nanodrug delivery system is conjugated with the cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid peptide (cRGD). [cite: 529, 95, 530, 96] Since ανβ3 integrin-specific ligands are overexpressed in liver cancer and neovascularization cells, a cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid peptide (cRGD) can be bound to AuNPs via gold-sulfur bonds for targeted liver cancer therapy. [cite: 530, 96, 531, 97, 532, 98] Perfluorohexane (PFH) and Ultrasound Imaging Perfluorohexane (PFH) is a stable, safe, and nontoxic liquid that can undergo a phase transition and enhance the ultrasound echo signal under ultrasonic stimulation and photothermal effects. [cite: 528, 94, 529, 95, 535, 100] This property makes it valuable for ultrasound imaging, allowing for the visualization of the nano-agent’s distribution and therapeutic effects. [cite: 535, 100, 536, 101] Mechanism of Action of the Nano-Agent The nano ultrasound contrast agent, ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD, functions through a multifaceted mechanism: Induction of Ferroptosis: ATO induces ferroptosis in tumor cells through GSH depletion and increased GPX4. [cite: 512, 74] The increased ROS can also directly kill tumor cells, thereby enhancing the synergistic effect. [cite: 512, 74, 513, 75, 513, 76, 514, 77] Photothermal Effect: AuNPs generate heat under NIR laser irradiation, contributing to tumor cell death. [cite: 506, 68, 507, 69, 508, 70, 509, 71] Immune Modulation: Ferroptosis and photothermal effects promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophage M1 polarization in the tumor microenvironment (TME). [cite: 514, 78] This activation of the immune system triggers an adaptive T-cell response, leading to the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that can attack tumor cells. [cite: 514, 78] Enhanced Immunotherapy: The anti-PD-L1 mAb further promotes the anti-tumor effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which enables synergistic treatment of orthotopic liver cancer, enhances the immune response, and reduces lung metastasis. [cite: 515, 79] In essence, this nanodrug delivery system could realize visual imaging, enable synergistic treatment of liver cancer, enhance the immune response and influence the phenotypes of macrophages in TME, thereby achieving enhanced liver tumor therapy, reducing metastasis, and enabling visual assessment of therapeutic efficacy. [cite: 536, 101, 537, 102] Synthesis and Characterization of the Nano-Agent The ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD nano-agent is synthesized using a filming-rehydration method with minor modifications to established protocols. [cite: 538, 103, 539, 104] Lipid Membranes: DSPE-PEG_{2K} , a biocompatible, biodegradable, and amphiphilic material, is used as a backbone to construct aptamer-functionalized core-shell nanoparticles. [cite: 539, 104, 540, 105, 541, 106] DSPE-PEG_{2k}-SI, DOTAP, DPPC, and cholesterol formed lipid membranes to load ATO and PFH, and to synthesize ATO/PFH NPs. [cite: 541, 106, 542, 107] Gold Nanoshells: AuNPs were deposited onto the surface of liposomes via reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl_{4}) following a previously reported method. [cite: 542, 107, 533, 98, 534, 99, 543, 108] Then, RGD-SH binds to the gold shell through SH bonds. [cite: 542, 107, 533, 98, 534, 99, 543, 108] cRGD Conjugation: cRGD-SH is then bound to the gold shell via SH bonds to achieve targeted delivery. [cite: 542, 107, 533, 98, 534, 99, 543, 108] The successful synthesis of the nano-agent is confirmed through various characterization techniques: Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): TEM confirmed the deposition of AuNPs on the liposome surface. [cite: 543, 108, 544, 109] Hydrodynamic Diameter and Zeta Potential: The hydrodynamic diameter was 121 ± 5 nm, and the Zeta potential was 10.47 ± 1.20 mV in aqueous solution. [cite: 544, 109, 545, 110, 546, 111] Size Distribution: The size range of the ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD was ≈100-150 nm. [cite: 545, 110, 546, 111] Stability Analysis: After storage at 4, 25, and 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum (5%, pH 7.4) for 7 days, there was no obvious change in particle size and Zeta potential, indicating good stability of the synthesized nanoparticles. [cite: 546, 111, 547, 112] UV-Vis Spectra: UV-vis spectra showed that ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD had a characteristic plasmonic coupling (between the AuNPs) absorption peak at 760 nm, while no resonance peak at the near-infrared wavelengths was detected in non-coated liposomes. [cite: 547, 112, 548, 113, 549, 114] Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS): EDS analysis further confirms the formation of a gold shell surrounding the liposome core. [cite: 547, 112, 548, 113, 549, 114] In Vitro Drug Release and Ultrasound Imaging The study also investigates the controlled release ability of ATO from the nanodrug delivery system and its ultrasound imaging capabilities. [cite: 549, 115, 550, 116] Drug Release: The drug release characteristics of ATO were detected at pH 7.4 and 6.5 (pH 6.5 was used to simulate the slightly acidic TME). [cite: 549, 115, 550, 116, 551, 117, 552, 118] Compared to the fast release of free ATO (≈92% in 24 h), ATO NPs-cRGD showed significant sustained release. [cite: 551, 117, 552, 118] ATO can be effectively released with the aid of an ultrasound therapeutic apparatus and low acidity TME (PH 6.5). [cite: 553, 120, 554, 121] The acoustic cavitation effect generated by UTMD is a process of vibration, expansion, contraction, and rupture of microbubbles, which lead to the destruction of the nanocarrier and the release of the drug encapsulated in the nanoparticles, thus promoting the selective release at the tumor site. [cite: 555, 122] Ultrasound Imaging: In vivo and in vitro imaging experiments were carried out with saline as a negative control and SonoVue contrast agent as a positive control to evaluate the ultrasound imaging ability of ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD. [cite: 556, 123, 557, 124, 558, 125] The contrast-enhanced images of SonoVue and ATO/PFH NPs@Au-CRGD were significantly enhanced in vitro after ultrasound exposure, and similar results were detected in in vivo imaging. [cite: 556, 123, 557, 124, 558, 125] Compared to commercial ultrasound contrast agents, the ATO/PFH NPS@Au-cRGD exhibited similar ultrasound imaging effects in tumors, clearly showing contrast enhancement in contrast mode, which could assess the dynamic blood perfusion of tumors visually, thereby realizing precise molecular imaging during treatment. [cite: 560, 127] Photothermal Properties: The photothermal properties of the ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD were investigated using a 760 nm laser to irradiate PBS, AuNPs, ATO, and ATO NPs@Au-cRGD. [cite: 561, 128, 562, 129] After 4 min of irradiation, the maximum temperatures of the AuNPs and ATO NPs@Au-cRGD were 54.2 ± 0.6°C and 48.7 ± 0.7°C, respectively.
