    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Liver cancer is a major global health concern, with approximately 1million new patients diagnosed each year. [cite: 502, 63, 64] Asignificant number of these patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage,making them ineligible for surgical treatments. [cite: 502, 63, 64] Insuch cases, traditional treatment methods like thermal ablation,chemotherapy, and immunotherapy often yield unsatisfactory results dueto the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor. [cite: 503, 65] Thepropensity of liver cancer to metastasize adds another layer ofdifficulty to treatment and severely impacts patient prognosis. [cite:504, 66] Consequently, there’s a critical need for research focused ondeveloping effective combination therapies that can enhance treatmentefficacy and reduce metastasis. [cite: 505, 67]</p><p>Combination therapy, which strategically employs multiple treatmentmodalities, has emerged as a promising approach to improve outcomes.[cite: 493, 54] By targeting various pathways and modulating the tumor’simmune microenvironment, combination therapy can more effectivelydisrupt cancer progression. [cite: 493, 54] Among the innovative toolsbeing explored for liver cancer treatment, nanodrug delivery systemshold significant promise. [cite: 494, 55] These systems offer thepotential for targeted drug delivery, reduced toxicity, and enhancedtherapeutic efficacy. [cite: 494, 55]</p><p>This study introduces a novel nano ultrasound contrast agent,abbreviated as ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD, designed to integrate diagnosis andtreatment for efficient ultrasound imaging and liver cancer therapy.[cite: 495, 56]</p><p>The core components of this system are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Arsenic trioxide (ATO):</strong> A therapeutic agentknown to induce ferroptosis, a distinct form of programmed cell death,in tumor cells. [cite: 495, 56, 512, 74]</p></li><li><p><strong>Perfluorohexane (PFH):</strong> A substance used toenhance the ultrasound echo signal. [cite: 495, 56, 528, 94]</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs):</strong> Act as a carrier forATO and PFH and facilitate photothermal therapy (PTT). [cite: 495, 56,508, 70]</p></li><li><p><strong>cRGD peptide:</strong> A targeting ligand that enhancesthe delivery of the nano-agent to liver cancer cells. [cite: 495, 56,529, 95]</p></li></ul><p>The research demonstrates that this nanodrug delivery system promotesthe release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) through ATO-inducedferroptosis and photothermal-induced immunogenic cell death. [cite: 496,57] This process enhances the synergistic effects of ATO andphotothermal therapy in human Huh7 and mouse Hepa1-6 cells. [cite: 496,57]</p><p>A key finding of the study is the system’s ability to activate theantitumor immune response and promote macrophage M1 polarization withinthe tumor microenvironment. [cite: 497, 58] Notably, these beneficialeffects were observed with low side effects in both subcutaneous andorthotopic liver cancer models. [cite: 497, 58]</p><p>Furthermore, the research reveals that combining the nanodrugdelivery system with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)immunotherapy inhibits tumor metastasis and establishes long-termimmunological memory in orthotopic liver cancer. [cite: 498, 59] Thiscombination not only enhances antitumor therapy and suppresses lungmetastasis but also enables visual assessment of therapeutic efficacy.[cite: 499, 60] These capabilities highlight the significant potentialof this nano-agent for clinical applications in treating liver cancer.[cite: 499, 60]</p><h2 id="detailed-discussion-of-key-components-and-mechanisms">DetailedDiscussion of Key Components and Mechanisms</h2><h3 id="arsenic-trioxide-ato-and-ferroptosis">Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) andFerroptosis</h3><p>Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has shown considerable clinical benefits inthe palliative treatment of unresectable primary liver cancer. [cite:518, 83] However, its clinical application is limited by high systemictoxicity, rapid renal elimination of ATO, and low delivery efficiency toliver cancer cells, which greatly reduce the therapeutic efficacy andlead to severe systemic toxicity. [cite: 519, 84, 520, 85, 86]</p><p>To address these limitations, nanotechnology-based nanodrug deliverysystems offer a promising solution. [cite: 521, 87] These systems cansignificantly improve the efficacy of ATO, reduce its toxicity, andachieve targeted drug delivery in liver cancer. [cite: 521, 87] SinceATO has a strong affinity for sulfhydryl groups (SH) in proteins, it cantheoretically inactivate a variety of enzymes containing SH, such asglutathione (GSH). [cite: 521, 87]</p><p>Glutathione (GSH) could assist glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inreducing toxic lipid peroxides (LPOs) to nontoxic hydroxy compound (LOH)to prevent LPO-mediated damage to cell membrane structure and function.[cite: 522, 88] The depletion of GSH could result in the inhibition ofGPX4 activity and a corresponding increase in intracellular LPO levels,ultimately leading to ferroptosis. [cite: 522, 88] Therefore, ATO mayinduce ferroptosis through GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation. [cite:522, 88] Moreover, the ferroptosis-induced release of TAAs from dyingcancer cells could further enhance the immune response. [cite: 522,88]</p><h3id="photothermal-therapy-ptt-and-gold-nanoparticles-aunps">PhotothermalTherapy (PTT) and Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs)</h3><p>Photothermal therapy (PTT) is an anticancer strategy that offersprecise targeting of tumors with minimal damage to surrounding healthytissues. [cite: 506, 68, 507, 69] Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) arewell-suited for PTT applications due to their good biocompatibility andexcellent optical properties. [cite: 508, 70]</p><p>When AuNPs are exposed to near-infrared (NIR) light, they efficientlyabsorb the light energy and convert it into heat. [cite: 509, 71] Thisphotothermal effect can damage tumor tissues or release therapeuticmolecules, such as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). [cite: 509, 71,516, 80] However, the therapeutic effect of AuNPs alone may be limited.[cite: 516, 80, 517, 81] The synergistic effect of combined chemo-PTTmay be a promising strategy for improving PTT efficacy. [cite: 517, 81,506, 68]</p><h3id="ultrasound-targeted-microbubble-destruction-utmd">Ultrasound-TargetedMicrobubble Destruction (UTMD)</h3><p>Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) can be exploitedto change the structures of cells to facilitate the targeted release ofnanodrugs into tumor cells, which could improve the efficacy of tumortreatment and prevent the systemic toxicity of antitumor drugs. [cite:525, 91] The nanoparticles (NPs) accumulate in tumor tissues through theenhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) and targeting effect.[cite: 526, 92] Then, UTMD can increase the permeability of the cellmembrane through the cavitation effect so that the drugs loaded in NPsare more easily released and taken up. [cite: 527, 93] Moreover, NPs canalso load imaging agents for visualizing therapy, such asperfluorohexane (PFH). [cite: 528, 94]</p><h3 id="the-role-of-crgd-peptide">The Role of cRGD Peptide</h3><p>In this study, the nanodrug delivery system is conjugated with thecyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid peptide (cRGD). [cite: 529, 95, 530,96] Since ανβ3 integrin-specific ligands are overexpressed in livercancer and neovascularization cells, a cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acidpeptide (cRGD) can be bound to AuNPs via gold-sulfur bonds for targetedliver cancer therapy. [cite: 530, 96, 531, 97, 532, 98]</p><h3 id="perfluorohexane-pfh-and-ultrasound-imaging">Perfluorohexane(PFH) and Ultrasound Imaging</h3><p>Perfluorohexane (PFH) is a stable, safe, and nontoxic liquid that canundergo a phase transition and enhance the ultrasound echo signal underultrasonic stimulation and photothermal effects. [cite: 528, 94, 529,95, 535, 100] This property makes it valuable for ultrasound imaging,allowing for the visualization of the nano-agent’s distribution andtherapeutic effects. [cite: 535, 100, 536, 101]</p><h2 id="mechanism-of-action-of-the-nano-agent">Mechanism of Action ofthe Nano-Agent</h2><p>The nano ultrasound contrast agent, ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD, functionsthrough a multifaceted mechanism:</p><ol type="1"><li><p><strong>Induction of Ferroptosis:</strong> ATO inducesferroptosis in tumor cells through GSH depletion and increased GPX4.[cite: 512, 74] The increased ROS can also directly kill tumor cells,thereby enhancing the synergistic effect. [cite: 512, 74, 513, 75, 513,76, 514, 77]</p></li><li><p><strong>Photothermal Effect:</strong> AuNPs generate heat underNIR laser irradiation, contributing to tumor cell death. [cite: 506, 68,507, 69, 508, 70, 509, 71]</p></li><li><p><strong>Immune Modulation:</strong> Ferroptosis and photothermaleffects promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophageM1 polarization in the tumor microenvironment (TME). [cite: 514, 78]This activation of the immune system triggers an adaptive T-cellresponse, leading to the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that canattack tumor cells. [cite: 514, 78]</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Immunotherapy:</strong> The anti-PD-L1 mAbfurther promotes the anti-tumor effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes byblocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which enables synergistic treatment oforthotopic liver cancer, enhances the immune response, and reduces lungmetastasis. [cite: 515, 79]</p></li></ol><p>In essence, this nanodrug delivery system could realize visualimaging, enable synergistic treatment of liver cancer, enhance theimmune response and influence the phenotypes of macrophages in TME,thereby achieving enhanced liver tumor therapy, reducing metastasis, andenabling visual assessment of therapeutic efficacy. [cite: 536, 101,537, 102]</p><h2 id="synthesis-and-characterization-of-the-nano-agent">Synthesis andCharacterization of the Nano-Agent</h2><p>The ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD nano-agent is synthesized using afilming-rehydration method with minor modifications to establishedprotocols. [cite: 538, 103, 539, 104]</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lipid Membranes:</strong> <spanclass="math-inline">DSPE-PEG_{2K}</span> , a biocompatible,biodegradable, and amphiphilic material, is used as a backbone toconstruct aptamer-functionalized core-shell nanoparticles. [cite: 539,104, 540, 105, 541, 106] <spanclass="math-inline">DSPE-PEG_{2k}</span>-SI, DOTAP, DPPC, andcholesterol formed lipid membranes to load ATO and PFH, and tosynthesize ATO/PFH NPs. [cite: 541, 106, 542, 107]</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Nanoshells:</strong> AuNPs were deposited onto thesurface of liposomes via reduction of chloroauric acid <spanclass="math-inline">(HAuCl_{4})</span> following a previously reportedmethod. [cite: 542, 107, 533, 98, 534, 99, 543, 108] Then, RGD-SH bindsto the gold shell through SH bonds. [cite: 542, 107, 533, 98, 534, 99,543, 108]</p></li><li><p><strong>cRGD Conjugation:</strong> cRGD-SH is then bound to thegold shell via SH bonds to achieve targeted delivery. [cite: 542, 107,533, 98, 534, 99, 543, 108]</p></li></ul><p>The successful synthesis of the nano-agent is confirmed throughvarious characterization techniques:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM):</strong> TEMconfirmed the deposition of AuNPs on the liposome surface. [cite: 543,108, 544, 109]</p></li><li><p><strong>Hydrodynamic Diameter and Zeta Potential:</strong> Thehydrodynamic diameter was 121 ± 5 nm, and the Zeta potential was 10.47 ±1.20 mV in aqueous solution. [cite: 544, 109, 545, 110, 546,111]</p></li><li><p><strong>Size Distribution:</strong> The size range of the ATO/PFHNPs@Au-cRGD was ≈100-150 nm. [cite: 545, 110, 546, 111]</p></li><li><p><strong>Stability Analysis:</strong> After storage at 4, 25, and37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and serum (5%, pH 7.4) for 7days, there was no obvious change in particle size and Zeta potential,indicating good stability of the synthesized nanoparticles. [cite: 546,111, 547, 112]</p></li><li><p><strong>UV-Vis Spectra:</strong> UV-vis spectra showed thatATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD had a characteristic plasmonic coupling (between theAuNPs) absorption peak at 760 nm, while no resonance peak at thenear-infrared wavelengths was detected in non-coated liposomes. [cite:547, 112, 548, 113, 549, 114]</p></li><li><p><strong>Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS):</strong> EDSanalysis further confirms the formation of a gold shell surrounding theliposome core. [cite: 547, 112, 548, 113, 549, 114]</p></li></ul><h2 id="in-vitro-drug-release-and-ultrasound-imaging">In Vitro DrugRelease and Ultrasound Imaging</h2><p>The study also investigates the controlled release ability of ATOfrom the nanodrug delivery system and its ultrasound imagingcapabilities. [cite: 549, 115, 550, 116]</p><ul><li><p><strong>Drug Release:</strong> The drug release characteristicsof ATO were detected at pH 7.4 and 6.5 (pH 6.5 was used to simulate theslightly acidic TME). [cite: 549, 115, 550, 116, 551, 117, 552, 118]Compared to the fast release of free ATO (≈92% in 24 h), ATO NPs-cRGDshowed significant sustained release. [cite: 551, 117, 552, 118] ATO canbe effectively released with the aid of an ultrasound therapeuticapparatus and low acidity TME (PH 6.5). [cite: 553, 120, 554, 121] Theacoustic cavitation effect generated by UTMD is a process of vibration,expansion, contraction, and rupture of microbubbles, which lead to thedestruction of the nanocarrier and the release of the drug encapsulatedin the nanoparticles, thus promoting the selective release at the tumorsite. [cite: 555, 122]</p></li><li><p><strong>Ultrasound Imaging:</strong> In vivo and in vitro imagingexperiments were carried out with saline as a negative control andSonoVue contrast agent as a positive control to evaluate the ultrasoundimaging ability of ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD. [cite: 556, 123, 557, 124, 558,125] The contrast-enhanced images of SonoVue and ATO/PFH NPs@Au-CRGDwere significantly enhanced in vitro after ultrasound exposure, andsimilar results were detected in in vivo imaging. [cite: 556, 123, 557,124, 558, 125] Compared to commercial ultrasound contrast agents, theATO/PFH NPS@Au-cRGD exhibited similar ultrasound imaging effects intumors, clearly showing contrast enhancement in contrast mode, whichcould assess the dynamic blood perfusion of tumors visually, therebyrealizing precise molecular imaging during treatment. [cite: 560,127]</p></li><li><p><strong>Photothermal Properties:</strong> The photothermalproperties of the ATO/PFH NPs@Au-cRGD were investigated using a 760 nmlaser to irradiate PBS, AuNPs, ATO, and ATO NPs@Au-cRGD. [cite: 561,128, 562, 129] After 4 min of irradiation, the maximum temperatures ofthe AuNPs and ATO NPs@Au-cRGD were 54.2 ± 0.6°C and 48.7 ± 0.7°C,respectively.</p></li></ul><h2 id="参考资料">参考资料</h2><blockquote><ul><li><ahref="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202300878">QiuY, Wu Z, Chen Y, Liao J, Zhang Q, Wang Q, Duan Y, Gong K, Chen S, WangL, Fan P, Duan Y, Wang W, Dong Y.
